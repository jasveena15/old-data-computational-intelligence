    "Agents and environments provide a useful framework for understanding and designing intelligent systems. By defining agents and environments, we can start to think about the kinds of tasks that an intelligent system might need to perform, the kinds of sensors and actuators it might need to have, and the kinds of knowledge and reasoning it might need to use to make decisions and take actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will study a simple vacuum cleaner agent that lives in a simple environment consisting of a n-location room. Each location can either be clean or dirty. The agent can perceive the state of the current location (clean or dirty) and its own location. The agent can perform two actions: `Suck`, which cleans the current location, and `Left` and `Right`, which move the agent to the other location.\n"

    "* **Perception methods**: Perception methods are used by the environment to provide sensory data to agents.\n",

It should be flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of agent types and behaviors, and should be modular and extensible to allow for easy customization and experimentation.\n"
